CONTACT
=======
Project developer Gabriel Sharp can be contacted
via email, however, it is usually a better choice
to drop me a line via github's messages feature
because I check that more often. If you MUST contact
me by mail:

  osirisgothra @ hotmail . com
  
 :sparkle: (isn't it sad that you have to put spaces in your email to prevent
  spammers from cut-copy-pasting them darn things. spammers: you have
  no place on the internet and have been a thorn in my side for nearly
  25 years now.. i hate them, i hate them all and you are all on my
  'list' so you better hope i dont get cancer or something!)
