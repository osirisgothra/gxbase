<h3>Update</h3>

Standardization, in a nutshell, has been applied project wide. The X.X.X.X branches represent old parts of the project
no longer in production. From here on out, all main work will be done in 'dev' and all stable changes will be 
merged to 'master'. This is less confusion for everyone. Also, as per standardization, all version numbers will be in
the form of tags and releases on github. The versioning system has been simplified and now is just year.month of that
release, if at all.

This project is dated.

Most of this project is being stripped of it's parts and being incorporated into autox, which represents the 'meat'
of the project's 3-year research/development run. I never intended this to be a serious project and was certain
it would never be released. However, since it was a lot of sidework, i choose to keep it here (plus I can't really
remove this repository anyway).
