#   
#   KdE's kdialog, ZENity, DIalog, and whipTAIL unification script
#   Used to standardize common options over all programs, autoselecting
#   what kind should be used depending on availability of program, and 
#   the current controlling tty or DISPLAY that is availble to the user.
#   The program also 'fills in' for features that exist in some programs
#   but not others. This program is also a sh-compatible script, which aims
#   to make it standardized some day -- because you can run it in place of
#   any of the programs (it checks it's name for this, symbolic linking is 
#   used for this reason). NOTE: If you do not name this script zenity, kdialog
#   dialog, or whiptail, the first argument MUST be the intended program's syntax!!
#   If no syntax is given, an error WILL result! This is to prevent users from
#   writing scripts that directly access this script without regard to which options
#   they are using, and, to continue to condone use of the above named programs
#   since my aim is not to put them out of business (because the internal alternative
#   is plain and nobody wants plain if they can have nice). Please RTFM before
#   commenting or reporting bugs!!!
