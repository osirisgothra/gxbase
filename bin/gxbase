=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gxbase> is a delegate shell that works like bash but also adds more features to the
shell aspect of it. The idea is for two modes of shell operation, and one mode of script
operation. Scripts are executed EXACTLY the same since gxbase is only a shell and not an
interpreter.

Transparent Mode

This is when shell commands are passed directly to bash, and no resources are required
to run in this mode unless the user switches back out of it.

Delegate mode

The default mode for gxbase, most operation is 1:1 with bash, except there are some
additions and features that can be added.
