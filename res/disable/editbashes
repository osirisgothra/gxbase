" -------------         5/24 - initial created copy
"                       5/31 - replaced bash-prompt with bash-aliases                         
"                              replaced bash_logout with bash-bindings
"                              added split for bash-prompt (7)
"                              removed wrap+mouse override commands (stupid)
"                              added notes (see below)
" notes
" -----
" this may look jammed up on your monitor if you use large text, 
"  small resolution, or both.
" if that's the case, you can type :only and zoom to your window of choice
"  after you've used the mouse to click it
" use CTRL+W twice to switch to next window (not in insert mode!)
" use ALT+X to save and exit ALL
" use ALT+S to save ALL              ( you will be reminded before entering )
" this works out best with: fullscreen terminal, Ubuntu Mono 12pt, 36" 1080p LCD monitors or better
" if you dont like it you can  comment all but the first line below, which will revert to the old behavior
" or rename editbashes_old to editbashes, which will make eb behave like it used to.
