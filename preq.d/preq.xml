					 5 all GxBase scripts need the processor PI to identify which script
             it belongs to, it is used to verify proper script contents
           6 there should be a processor phase="start" and "stop", these
						 assure they XML processor that the whole file exists, and that
						 corruption/missing data is not happening. The stop phase does
						 not need to include the "script" attribute  (note that 
             processor actually means the <?pr> tag, and the script element
						 is a singular 's' (phase is unchanged) this shortening is for
						 convenience. These rules veracious among the entire XML language
             used with GxBase.
