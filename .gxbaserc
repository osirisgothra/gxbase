# .gxbaserc
#
# configuration and identification file for gxbase
# essential for configuration
# put user-specific .gxbaserc in ~/.gxbaserc
#

# dont change the flavor and id, they are used to identify the root directory where gxbase's files are on the host
# you must link the /gxbase/res/bashrc to .bashrc if you plan to use it, from there you customize it for yourself
# using the various tools provided by gxbase. It is NOT recommended to use gxbase AND another .bashrc as well.
# if you MUST, then gxbase's bashrc would have to be sourced at the end of your .bashrc file: "source ~/.bashrc"
# however many things will be overwritten if you do this. Use the merge .bashrc tool to import custom settings!
# (the /etc/skel/.bashrc is very old and outdated, at most)
# It is also recommended you use the provided /gxbase/res/etc/bashrc in place of /etc/bashrc if you can, it will
# dramatically speed things up!

# flavor: relfects the flavor, the repository in which this gxbase came from, so you can check for newer versions 
#         with gxbupdate
# gxbaseid: the identity that scripts use to identify this gxbase flavor, one-time generated time-based uuid (dont change!!)
# release: the version number used in the version information when using gxver or the --version flags of gxbase commands
#          this is first part of the true version shown there.
# phase:   the phase of development: broken=not usable at all in current state    beta=complete, but not fully tested/debugged
#                                     alpha=usable but not complete in any way    release=complete and tested up to standards
#                                     final=not to be updated past current phase  forked=new developments, use this and define subphase
#
# subphase: use this for forked versions, you can define any terms you want here
#           for the original gxbase, the only value I use is "notforked" 
#           needed in order to relax some version dependant scripts, if they 
#           come into existence
# commit:   the commit number for this git branch, incremented each time a commit is done. Kind of like a build number but
#           since no compiling of scripts is done, we don't call them builds.
