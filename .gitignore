# ** vba is also locally known as a (unix) vimball archive, i am not sure who used it first, microsoft or vim, but it is a dangerous (not to me)
#    extension that is targedted at "stupid people" in hopes they will run it and ruin their machine, i filter it out just because i dont want
#    any files that may be a flag raiser to antivirus programs, since lately they treat people like morons and try to quarentine EVERYTHING and
#    are overly paranoid
# *** i discourage use of 3-lettered extensions that fail to clearly identify the file or are needless (like 'readme.now' when 'README' will do)
#     i also will not use UPPERCASE filenames on anything other than text documentation files used solely for informational purposes at install or
#     unpack time. The uppercase filenames are intended to allow the user/developer to easily spot the files they first need to read amongst the 
#     other ones they dont.

# gxbase-specific or generated files (not meant to be in the source tree, that is)
# each entry should be explained,
#  .hash  - used by *-sudo commands in conjunction with 'meanmode' used to hash out binaries so 
#           the scan does not take as long sucessive times in a row. delete this file if you need
#           a new scan (developers usually not users) or have added some script/binary to gxbase/bin
#           NOTE: this is the file name ".hash" not the extension, files with the extension ".hash"
#           like "gxbase.hash" would still be considered for tree. This will be a one-filename entry!
#  *.db   - ext used by any generated database (file-format agnostic). This could be but not limited
#           to, (in order of probability, most likely to least likely): plain text (UTF-8), unicode
#           text (UTF-16, LE), csv database (UTF encoded 8 or 16-LE), mysql, berkely (libdb), accdb
#           (odbc, unlikely though), and even least likely, other database formats i never use :)
