GXBASE - General Extensions for the Bash Shell Environment

The helpers-experimental-README

Document Changes
----------------
12 2013 Nov	Original Release	Stated that 0.1.0 is the current version
23 2014 Apr	Update			Changes to reflect that 0.1.0 is now a previous version

Notes
-----

Be advised that the helpers-experimental branch spans not only this version of gxbase, but all versions
and may have their own versions as well. Please see the documentation for the helpers in each version
of gxbase AND the helpers themselves, where applicable.


Symlink Is Unreadable (invalid)?
--------------------------------

  The "helpers-experimental" directory is part of:

	gitorious.org/gxbase/helpers-experimental

  However, this repository is found in:

	gitorious.org/gxbase/gxbase.git
	[after update this will be subversioned]
	gitorious.org/gxbase/0.1.0/gxbase.git

I've named the symlink to work if you clone both branches the way 
they are in the repository, if you do not then you will have to 
re-create the symlink. However, you can delete it because it does 
not actually have any affect on gxbase. If a binary is needed, 
it will be documented but at this time none of the helpers are active 
in this version (0.1.0) of the gxbase repository.

Please read: docs/README and docs/html/index.html for details
