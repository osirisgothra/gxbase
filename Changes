0.3.1.15	Jan 17 2015 - Beginning of GxBase's True Structural Design and Purpose

			During this stage (for an unspecified amount of time), I will be drawing the final blueprints
			for the design of gxbase. There have been MANY experimental frameworks, designs, scripts, functions,
			cross-language tests, IDEs, helper experimentation, module dissections, disassembling, recompiling, forking,
			and so on, enough to make my git trees into a nasty old forest.  Now is the time that I will be accepting any
			input for the actual makeup and function of the main program, now that there is to be one (gxbase originally
			was baseless and non-centric). In order to create the omnipresence I need in bash, I will be running gxbase
			as a perl program, it will be in charge of spawning, monitoring, and controlling bash session. There was just
			not enough control (without a lot of work and messy script code) to be had with pure bash. gxbase will be on
			display (it's plans) on the website, for details visit http://gxbase.github.io, or osirisgothra.github.io/gxbase

			latest version?   type 'git clone git://github.com/gxbase' or
								   'git clone git://gitorious.org/gxbase/main.git'
					
			IMPORTANT TODOS: The helpers NEED to go to submodule soon, it's a pain and I sure would love it if someone else
							 could allow me to be lazy and show me how to get that lined up so i dont get inconsistencies like
							 I always do when dealing with submodules (and when getting rid of them, which seems quite annoying)
