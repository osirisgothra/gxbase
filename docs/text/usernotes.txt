#
#         FILE: ../alias.d/coreutils.sh
# COMMAND ATTN: alias chug
#
# ASKED BY: Anonymous

# QUESTION: Please, why-oh-why did you not use 'chown user:group' here?
# ANSWER: because  chown  and  chgrp share near-identical[1] arguments. 
# Therefore, the alias command chug, can also do this, if I changed 
# it # to user:group, i would then need to check the command line for 
# properness extract the user name, and the command line apart, which 
# defeats the speed and simplicity of an alias, in fact documenting this 
# is wasting space too in the file, that's why it is under USER NOTES, 
# and is one of the first.
