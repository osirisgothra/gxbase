This is yet another analysis of the default structure setup of bash calls when running in a default scheme (files that
were distributed and put in place by the distributions and close installs themselves). Nothing had been tampered with
by third parties, especially gxbase, at this point. This report shows how when a login (usually tty, or when using -l
with xterms), the bash completion bootstrap ends up being called twice. For this reason, my plan to use the BCB to start
gxbase has been abandoned. I can't expect this to be fixed 'soon' and more importantly, this is already default and expected
on just about every GNU linux based workstation out there among others. An example of my startup, with ALL scripts in /etc
and my home directory tagged (which was done by pretagging using some debugging commands and then putting the tags in place).
The first line of each script is modified to echo the name of BASH_SOURCE[0] (the callee) and BASH_SOURCE[1] (the caller).
The resulting output of a login via tty terminal follows:

As expected, using xterm with /bin/bash -l yields the same behavior.
