       --install link name path priority [--slave link name path]...
              Add a group of alternatives to the system.  link is the generic name for the master link,
              name  is  the name of its symlink in the alternatives directory, and path is the alterna‐
              tive being introduced for the master link.  The arguments after --slave are  the  generic
              name,  symlink  name  in  the alternatives directory and the alternative path for a slave
              link.  Zero or more --slave options, each followed by three arguments, may be  specified.
              Note  that  the  master  alternative must exist or the call will fail. However if a slave
              alternative doesn't exist, the corresponding slave alternative link will  simply  not  be
              installed  (a  warning  will still be displayed). If some real file is installed where an
              alternative link has to be installed, it is kept unless --force is used.

              If the alternative name specified exists already in the  alternatives  system's  records,
              the  information supplied will be added as a new set of alternatives for the group.  Oth‐
              erwise, a new group, set to automatic mode, will be added with this information.  If  the
              group is in automatic mode, and the newly added alternatives' priority is higher than any
              other installed alternatives for this group, the symlinks will be updated to point to the
              newly added alternatives.

       --set name path
              Set the program path as alternative for name.  This is equivalent to --config but is non-
              interactive and thus scriptable.

       --remove name path
              Remove an alternative and all of its associated slave links.   name  is  a  name  in  the
