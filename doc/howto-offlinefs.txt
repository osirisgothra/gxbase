Offline Filesystem

README-OFFLINE.txt			The Network Filesystem You are Trying To Use is OFFLINE
howto-offlinefs.txt			Your Network Filesystem Ofline Help File (linked source)

If you are reading the README-OFFLINE.txt, that means whatever filesystem of the
directory you are in, ${PWD}, is offline. If you are using GXBASE, this along
with a few other text files, are shown automatically upon directory change.

NOTE: I assume you realize if you are not root, you must start all root commands
      by typing 'sudo [command line]'. You need sudo / admin rights for this.
			If you dont have the specfied right, try using 'sudo su' to become root or
			logout and log back in as root [not recommended]. It is recommended to 
			ALWAYS use sudo or gen-sudo (gxbase users) which will automatically map
			nondestructive sudo-requiring commands to sudo for you. You can get
			gxbase by typing 
			
			'cd /; sudo git clone git://gitorious.org/gxbase/current.git;. /gxbase/bin/gxbase'

			This will set up gxbase for all users on a user-to-user basis they will
			have the chance to say yes or no to the use of gxbase integration. GXBASE
			is a passive extension library for bash with some tools to help power users
			and power script writers.


Remedies:

	RESTORE OFFENDING FILESYSTEM (ONE DIRECTORY ONLY):
			Mount the offending filesystem, right where you are, type:
			
			mount "$PWD" 

			as long as the entry is in fstab and correct, if the machine is up
			it will remount the current filesystem


	RESTORE ALL NETWORK MOUNTS

			If all directories are offline, quickly up them by typing:

			mountall



	MOUNT A BROKEN NETWORK FILESYSTEM:


			if the network name matches the directory's name, you can use

			sudo mount $(basename "$PWD"):/ -t nfs "$PWD"

			The hostname and directory name must match and contain no spaces or
			other illegal hostname/dirname symbols. This assumes that you want
			to mount the root filesystem. You can exchange '/' for any export you
			want like '/adminfiles' or '/www-root'

			Because the entry is not in fstab, this is a one-shot deal. If you want
			it every time, you will have to add the entry to fstab. Or you can use
      gxbase's fstabmount command to add an entry AND mount the volume.
			The fstabmount uses the EXACT same parameters as 'mount' so you do not need
			to know anything about fstabmount to use it. you can also use mtabmount
			which copies non-system, read-write, nfs, ext, ntfs, smb filesystems to
			your fstab. But beware that this command adds ALL of the mounts not
			currently in fstab, that are in mtab which is everything mounted, with
			the exception of read-only media. This however includes SSDs, and
			DVD-RAMs and simmilar.

 EDIT FSTAB YOURSELF

 			Please read fstab(5) for details 
			
 REGULAR USERS (NO ADMIN RIGHTS)

		Remedies (easiest first)

			Restart the system (press ctrl-alt-delete)

			Cold boot (power off and wait 5 seconds before power-on)

			Log out, and log back in (the graphical desktop Manager, not the shell)

			Contact the Administrator (of your system)

			Try Booting Recovery Mode or Alternate Kernel

			Read Manuals (type 'info nfs'  at any prompt to get started)
