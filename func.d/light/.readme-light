Warning: ALL files that are NOT hidden (not starting with dot like .readme-light) WILL be used
as lightfunctions. Make sure you don't put things that wont get along with 'eval' builtin because
it could cause harm more than good if misused. Typically you'll want to keep things at one line. If
you require more complex definitions, use func.sh, or define a new file.
