NOTICE - DEPRECIATED

This project is now depreciated and will not be getting
anymore updates except for coercing/directing those interested
to it's child project, the end-result of the development done 
here and elsewhere (much like the original gxbase, which was
codenamed excore, gxcore, gx, xc, etc. depending on where it
was at that time (most of which was on gitorious, not here at
github).

I have kept a few "historical" stages available here. They are
very different stages that originall had codenames but since I
cant remember exactly, I decided to just sick with the numbering
system:

0.0.0.0 - first incantation (core?)
0.1.0.0 - second incantation (gxcore or xc?)
0.2.0.0 - third (gx or excore?)
0.2.0.1 - fourth (gxbase I)
master - fifth (gxbase final)
dev - fifth (gxbase final, dev*)

*though 'dev' implies future development, it is likely not to happen. I set this up like this so that if for some
crazy reason I change my mind or someone decides to fork, it will be available to fill that need. The branches that
are related (or not related) are:

Unrelated Branches		|	Comment(s)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.0.0.0				|	no relations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.1.0.0				|	no relations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.2.0.0				|	no relations, but contents may have been duplicated from above
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Related Branches			How?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.2.0.1 			|	original rewrite of gxbase
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- old insignifigant changes 	|	changes done in 2013-14

master				|	merged from changes above and LOCKED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Possible Installation - USE AT OWN RISK!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The below install instructions were for the release that did not happen. If you wish to *try* to use gxbase, follow
these instructions:

1) start a bash shell and login as the user you wish to use gxbase with, if you want system-wide then
   login with the root account or use sudo before the commands.

2) Type (or cut and paste) the following -- typing is recommended because less errors are likely!

For Current User Only
---------------------
```bash
mkdir ~/.local/share -p
cd ~/.local/share
git clone git://github.com/osirisgothra/gxbase
cd ~/.local/share/gxbase
echo export PATH=$_/tools:$_/bin:$_/lib:$_:$PATH >> ~/.bashrc
```

Entire System-Wide
------------------
```bash
mkdir /usr/local/share -p
cd /usr/local/share
git clone git://github.com/osirisgothra/gxbase
cd /usr/local/share/gxbase
echo export PATH=$_/tools:$_/bin:$_/lib:$_:$PATH >> /etc/bash.bashrc

3) after logging off and logging back on, the gxbase interpreter ('gxbase') and it's tools
will be available. However, it is depreciated so it never got into development, so unless
you are forking this project, doing so is pointless for the most part unless you are
just curious.

**Stop here until you wish to rid yourself of GXBASE**

4) Uninstallation is the reverse of the installation
   assuming you didnt modify your .bashrc or bash.bashrc since
   the installation:

User
----
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
rm -fr ~/.local/share/gxbase
cat ~/.bashrc | grep gxbase -v > $TMP
mv $TMP ~/.bashrc -f
unset TMP
source ~/.bashrc #to get rid of gxbase in path
hash -r #to get rid of refs to gxbase executables
```

System-Wide
-----------
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
rm -fr /usr/local/share/gxbase
cat /etc/bash.bashrc | grep gxbase -v > $TMP
mv $TMP /etc/bash.bashrc -f
unset TMP
source /etc/bash.bashrc #to get rid of gxbase in path
hash -r #to get rid of refs to gxbase executables
```

:sparkle:&nbsp;It is probably better just to relogin than to rely on sourcing but
it nearly fool proof, except on heavily customized systems.

:sparkle:&nbsp;If you use other startup files (like .bash-login, etc) then you will
have to take different steps which should be obvious given the above instructions

:sparkle:&nbsp;NetworkFs based systems that want gxbase over all machines should use
the /usr/share location instead of /usr/local/share per the filesystem standardization
rules set forth for linux.

:sparkle:&nbsp;Windows users: unless you are using cygwin, i don't think this is
for you. It may not even work there. That does not mean you cant fork it to make
it work for windows.

:sparkle:&nbsp;Mac users: assuming you know the little details, should be able to
use this without too much trouble.

:sparkle:&nbsp;The next release (first release) is not going to be done by me. But keep
watch because someone may decide to take over the project. But don't hold your breath!

:sparkle:&nbsp; The original README now follows, it is pointless, but here it is...






Original Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is the original README, I don't think much of it applies anymore, see above for install instructions
that *might* work, the instructions below were working toward the release that didnt happen.

gxbase

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

(It is also noted that I am lazy and have no intersest in changing 
boilerplate text, though I did put this note here, so it kind just contra-
dicts what I just said...)

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install




SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.

    perldoc gxbase

README (Information about this distro)

All the update information shall be here from 0.3.15.1 on, otherwise
you can see 'README.md' for a more general (be it outdated) description
of the project.

0.3.15.1 - Due to unpopular demand, I have constructed a crude versioning system
           and dub it the 'MNYM' system. (Major.miNor.Year.Month system). It has
           a nice ring, if you can bring yourself to actually pronounce it.
           
0.3.15.2 - Nothing here but monthly updates (this text)

0.3.15.3 - Making the rest of my hub projects confirm to MNYM will be the task of
           this month and hopefully will be complete by 0.3.15.5.

0.3.15.3 - Commencing some changes to the tree, now following the official (at least
           as far as I could find via google) CPAN module tree. And yes, gxbase is 
           now officially to be written in 90% PERL / 10% BASH instead of the previous
           agreed 90% BASH / 10% PERL ratio... I just had it backwards :)
