gxbase

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

(It is also noted that I am lazy and have no intersest in changing 
boilerplate text, though I did put this note here, so it kind just contra-
dicts what I just said...)

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.

README (Information about this distro)

All the update information shall be here from 0.3.15.1 on, otherwise
you can see 'README.md' for a more general (be it outdated) description
of the project.

0.3.15.1 - Due to unpopular demand, I have constructed a crude versioning system
           and dub it the 'MNYM' system. (Major.miNor.Year.Month system). It has
           a nice ring, if you can bring yourself to actually pronounce it.
           
0.3.15.2 - Nothing here but monthly updates (this text)

0.3.15.3 - Making the rest of my hub projects confirm to MNYM will be the task of
           this month and hopefully will be complete by 0.3.15.5.
