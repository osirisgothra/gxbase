{"name":"Gxbase","tagline":"GXBASE Related Projects","body":"### What is GXBASE\r\nIt is an ongoing, experimental project that I am doing during my study into the bash shell. I have introduced certain elements into the startup, run, and shutdown of the bash shell to see if I can get any interesting results from it via the many commands, functions, aliases, etc.\r\n\r\n### What GXBASE Is Not\r\nIt is not meant to be software that you can rely on. It is for expermental purposes only at this time. If you want to play with it by all means go ahead but be warned it is not stable.\r\n\r\n### What Platforms is GXBASE Designed For\r\nAny platform that has a linux kernel (2.16+) and a functioning version of bash (3.4+ preferred). Also, an xterm-truecolor or xterm-256color terminal would be prefered, using a keyboard layout deigned for the XFREE86 scheme (for Alt, Meta, etc and Function Keys).\r\n\r\nI am developing and testing on the current platforms:\r\n\r\n- Ubuntu Precise 12.04*, Quantal 12.10, Raring 13.04, Saucy 13.10, Trusty 14.04*, Utopic 14.10, and (soon to be Vivid 15.04) (* = LTS versions)\r\n- Intel x86 \"i386\" and Intel x86_64 (EMT64 or \"64-bit\") Processors\r\n- AMD \"APU\" Processors\r\n- Linux Kernels through 3.13.0-43 (generic, generic PAE, genric low-latency, etc)\r\n- Graphics AMD (ATI!) Radeon (drm-radeon), NVIDIA GeForce (nvidia-340/nvidia-uvm-340)\r\n\r\n- Windows (limited) testing in cygwin is done via virtualbox on Windows XP (fully and legally licensed!) only because I paid for the thing and I hate sitting and watching 100 bucks go to waste on the shelf. However, this testing is _minimal_.\r\n\r\n### Project Goal\r\n\r\nThe main project goal is to make the bash shell easier to use by creating an environment that is easy to configure on-the-fly, with little effort from the user. At the same time, allowing things like aliases, functions, variables, to be changed, without worry of adding them into a 'configuration file'. At this time, these goals are no where near being met, but I am trying multiple methods to see what works best -- so things can get a bit messy. Have fun trudging...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGabriel Thomas Sharp (project manager) <osirisgothra@hotmail.com>\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease write the main author to get any kind of support via the email links provided above.","google":"UA-1360113-580257-21","note":"Don't delete this file!
