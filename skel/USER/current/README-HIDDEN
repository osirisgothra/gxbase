gxbase/skel/USER/current : user's home directory files (current version)

* For previous versions of gxbase, look at gxbase/skel/USER/old (mostly kept for archival/informational purposes)

* Make sure you use 'ls -a' so you can view the files, all files in here are hidden because they go in the user's HOME directory. 

* Developers should LINK these to their .bashrc and .config/bashrc to prevent sync problems.

* The .bashrc_dircolors.db file is NOT required, it will be created by the shell if it is not present

* The .bash_logout is the only other item required in the root home directory, all others go into .config/bashrc
